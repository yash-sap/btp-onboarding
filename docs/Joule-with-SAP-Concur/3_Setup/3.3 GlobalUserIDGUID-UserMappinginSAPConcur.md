The SAP Global User ID is a unique value identifier across the SAP Landscape, and this unique value is generated from the SAP Cloud Identity Services by default when a user is created. This GUID is required to be the same in your SAP Concur System for Joule to be operational for the users. In this step, we will see how to replicate the GUID from your SAP SCI to the SAP Concur system.

Note:

*For more information on GUID and how to manage it, see the [link here](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-identity/system-integration-guide/global-user-id-in-integration-scenarios).

*If you are using MS Entra Object ID and wish to continue as a GUID, you may refer to this [link ](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-identity/system-integration-guide/step-by-step-example-for-setting-up-global-user-id)for the setup.

In the current release, we do this manually by copying the GUID from SAP Cloud Identity Services to SAP Concur, but the SAP product teams will soon automate this process. Let’s take a look at how to achieve this manually.

To begin, you will need the **“Import/Extract Monitor"** role in the SAP Concur system. Once you have this role, you can download the sample file attached, which is in “**UTF-8 format**” as shown below.

We will edit the following values. In our case, we are using the Employee ID from SAP Concur.

You can follow the [User export from the IAS process](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-identity-services/cloud-identity-services/export-existing-users-of-tenant-of-identity-authentication?locale=en-US) to get the SAP Global ID and create a flat file according [to the SAP Concur 315 record type](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_CONCUR/07e27aa97f4a4bf6b0de7810e7efd6f0/f41e73bdf6704ba0996d490f47995e88.html?locale=en-US) for the SAP Global ID Importer.

Note that row 1 with the value “100” is mandatory; do not modify or edit this line. Row 2 shows the required values, and row 3 gives you the samples. In most cases, it's our understanding that Concur customers are aware of this flat file process, and you can find the details of this process here: [315 (SAP Global User ID Importer)](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_CONCUR/07e27aa97f4a4bf6b0de7810e7efd6f0/f41e73bdf6704ba0996d490f47995e88.html).

Once the file is ready with user details to import the GUID (recommend testing it with a few users and then adding more), you can log in to your SAP Concur system and navigate to **Home**  -> click on **Tools** -> and click on **Import/Export Monitor** -> click on the option Import, and click on **“Upload”**, select the file that you have created.

The monitor page is only available for users with the "**Import/Extract Monitor**" role.

Once you have the file uploaded, look for the option “Import Name= **EMPLOYEE_**” and click on "**Run Now**". In case you do not see this option to “Run Now”, you may have to wait for the daily schedule. Once completed, you should be able to see the **Success** message of the **Last Run Status**.

Note: We do not have an option to validate this in the Concur system if the GUID is mapped to the users. However, you can check with API Access, and you may need the Concur web service license to check the GUID API access.
