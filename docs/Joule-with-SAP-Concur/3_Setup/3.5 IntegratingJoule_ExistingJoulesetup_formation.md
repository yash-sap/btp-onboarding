In this section, we will show you how to activate Joule in SAP Concur in the context of an existing Joule formation.

To integrate your system, you can navigate to your SAP BTP Formations, look for the existing formation, and click on Include system.

Note:

Please ensure you have the same **SAP Cloud Identity Services** used for your Unified Setup, as shown in the image below, and that the prerequisites are completed
If you are using the SAP Concur sandbox/test system for initial setup with other SAP LoB Applications,  we understand that the users may be appended with “xxx@xx.uat” in your SAP Concur for Login. Please ensure you are using a common email address in all your non-prod systems, which can be authenticated by SAP IAS and can help you achieve a unified Joule experience
